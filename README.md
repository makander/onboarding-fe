<h1>Welcome to the Border project</h1>

This is my exam project @ Chas Academys fullstack web developer program.

I used to work in IT as a system administrator. One of the regular tasks I had to do aside from working with systems and networking was to onboard and offbord users from said systems. 

This is a task that depends on a different departments collaborating, like finance and the service department. More often than not some cruical task would be missed and the new employee would have to wait a couple of days to get the access it needed or the piece of equipment that was missing.  

This application attempts to solve this problem by creating creating lists that contain tasks. The application can then notify the users in these lists by email or slack when the lists/tasks change status.
